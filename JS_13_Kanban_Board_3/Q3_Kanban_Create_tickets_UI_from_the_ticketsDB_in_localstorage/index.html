<!-- Q1. Kanban Q13: Create tickets UI from the ticketsDB in localstorage

Raw Problem
Write a JavaScript program in the script.js file to:

Create all the ticket's UI, based on the data present in ticketsDB in localstorage

This question is a succession to the question, "Kanban Q5: Automate Ticket Creation from Input"

You have been provided the boilerplate code that handles the creation of a ticket in UI,
you need to add new code to the area marked in the script.js file to ensure that a ticket is created for all the data present in ticketsDB.

Hint:
You need to store the values in Storage Object in an array, with the help of getItem() and JSON.parse() methods.
For each value (object) in the array, create a corresponding ticket in the UI.

You can visit the "Kanban Q5: Automate Ticket Creation from Input" question again to get better idea of the boilerplate code.
Further, please focus on passing testcases to submit the problem successfully. -->
