<!-- Q2. Kanban Q12: Deleting a ticket from ticketsDB in localstorage

Raw Problem
Write a JavaScript program in the script.js file to:

To update the ticketsArr and ticketsDB Storage Object in the localstorage.

This question is a succession to the question, "Kanban Q8: Button to Delete Ticket from UI"

You have been provided the boilerplate code that handles the deletion of the ticket from UI,
you need to add new code to the area marked in the script.js file to ensure the task to update ticketsDB in localstorage.

Hint:
You need to write a function first to get the index of the ticket being deleted by matching the ids,
then use this index to delete the item from the ticketArr and then update the ticketsDB with the updated array after stringifying it.

You can visit the "Kanban Q8: Button to Delete Ticket from UI" question again to get better idea of the boilerplate code.
Further, please focus on passing testcases to submit the problem successfully. -->
