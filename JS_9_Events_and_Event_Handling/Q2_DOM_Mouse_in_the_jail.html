<!-- Q2. DOM Q5: Mouse in the jail
Raw Problem
Write a JavaScript program to perform the following task:

You are given an empty cell.
Whenever the mouse enters the cell,
a jail should be drawn over it.
And it should be removed once it leaves.

URL of the image: https://d2beiqkhq929f0.cloudfront.net/public_assets/assets/000/055/850/original/jail.jpg?1699030242


NOTE :
Here cursor is referred to as the mouse and the box as the empty cell.
To draw the jail:
Use the background image provided and set it as the background for the cell when the mouse enters the cell.

Use the below-mentioned method to set the image as background:
element.style.background = url(image_src) -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<!-- Please NOTE that the link to assets (like images) need to be set in global context.
For example:
To access an image from assets folder correct way to set src attribute is 

src = 'profile.png'

instead of 

src = './assets/profile.png'

        })
