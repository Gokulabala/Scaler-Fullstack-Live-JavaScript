<!-- Q3. DOM Q8: Making a weird button
Raw Problem
A button of class 'double' exists inside the parent div of id '#doubleHolder' in the HTML.
Write a JavaScript program such that whenever the button is clicked :

1. It is destroyed (removed from the parent div)
2. Two new buttons are created in its place. (inside the same parent div)
3. The new buttons should also inherit the same feature. Making it a recursive feature.

Hint: Use the class of 'double' and add the functionality to all the buttons having a class of 'double'
i.e., All new buttons should also have 'double' as class

Refer to the test cases to further understand the requirements to submit the problem. -->

For example:
To access an image from assets folder correct way to set src attribute is 

src = 'profile.png'

instead of 

src = './assets/profile.png'
